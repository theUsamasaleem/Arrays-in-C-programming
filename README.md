Arrays in C programming

Problem-1 (2 Points)
Write a program in C to store 10 elements in an array and print it.
Sample Input: Input 10 elements in the array: element - 0: 1 element - 1: 1 element - 2: 2
....... Sample Output: Elements in array are: 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Problem-2 (2 Points)
Write a program in C to find the maximum and minimum element in an array.
Sample Input: Input the number of elements to be stored in the array :3 Input 3 elements in the array: element - 0: 45 element - 1: 25 element - 2: 21
Sample Output: Maximum element is: 45 Minimum element is: 21

Problem-3 (2 Points)
Write a program in C to copy the elements of one array into another array.
Sample Input: Input the number of elements to be stored in the array :3 Input 3 elements in the array: element - 0: 15 element - 1: 10 element - 2: 12
Sample Output: The elements stored in the first array are: 15 10 12 The elements copied into the second array are: 15 10 12

Problem-4 (2 Points)
Write a program in C to merge two arrays of same size sorted in descending order.
Sample Input: Input the number of elements to be stored in the first array :3 Input 3 elements in the array: element - 0: 1 element - 1: 2 element - 2: 3
Input the number of elements to be stored in the second array :3 Input 3 elements in the array : element - 0: 1 element - 1: 2 element - 2: 3

Problem-5 (2 Points)
Write a program in C to count the frequency of each element of an array.
Sample Input: Input the number of elements to be stored in the array :3 Input 3 elements in the array: element - 0: 25 element - 1: 12 element - 2: 43

Problem-6 (2 Points)
